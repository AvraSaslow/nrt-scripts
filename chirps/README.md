## Tropical and Temperate Rainfall Dataset, Climate Hazard InfraRed Precipitation with Stations: CHIRPS (USGS, USAID, NASA, NOAA)

### What is CHIRPS? 

Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a 30+ year quasi-global rainfall dataset. Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes), starting in 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates 0.05° resolution satellite imagery with in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. As of February 12th, 2015, version 2.0 of CHIRPS is complete and available to the public. For detailed information on CHIRPS, please refer to our paper in Scientific Data.

More information regarding CHIRPS can be found in the USGS publication (Funk et al., 2014), at the Funk et al. (2015), or at http://chg-wiki.geog.ucsb.edu/wiki/CHIRPS_FAQ.
