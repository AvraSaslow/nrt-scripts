Data Source Criteria

OpenAQ-aggregate data are gathered in real-time from government agencies and no guarantees can be made for their accuracy. All quality control measures should be done by the user. OpenAQ is an ever-evolving process that is shaped by its community.

(1) Data must be of one of these pollutant types: PM10, PM2.5, sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and black carbon (BC).

(2) Data must be from an official-level outdoor air quality source, as defined as data produced by a government entity or international organization. At this stage, are not include data from low-cost, temporary, and/or indoor sensors. 

(3) Data must be ‘raw’ and reported in physical concentrations on their originating site. Data cannot be shared in an 'Air Quality Index' or equivalent (e.g. AQI, PSI, API) format.

(4) Data must be at the ‘station-level,’ associable with geographic coordinates, not aggregated into a higher (e.g. city) level.

(5) Data must be from measurements averaged between 10 minutes and 24 hours.
